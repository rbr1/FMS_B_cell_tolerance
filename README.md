# FMS_B_cell_tolerance

A critical unanswered question in FMS is whether B cell tolerance—the immune system’s precaution against autoimmunity—is fundamentally compromised. By integrating high-resolution BCR repertoire sequencing, deep phenotyping, and functional assays in a well-characterised patient cohort, we uncover profound defects in peripheral B cell tolerance, including failed anergy and dysregulated clonal selection mirroring autoimmune pathology. These findings not only redefine FMS as a disorder of immune dysregulation but also unveil novel therapeutic opportunities to restore B cell homeostasis, offering hope for mechanism-driven interventions in this debilitating condition.
